# Project 1 - Correlation Between Weather Conditions and Production Metric Yield in Rendering Plant üè≠

**Overview**

This project aims to investigate the correlation between weather conditions and the yield of rendered products. The focus is on analyzing the Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) data values, which include ash, moisture, protein, and fat. The goal is to determine if weather conditions are a significant factor affecting the yield and customer complaints in rendering plants.

**Project Description**

Rendering plants often face complaints related to yield and volume of products. This project examines if weather conditions, rather than business operations, are responsible for fluctuations in product yield. By analyzing the correlation between LIMS data values and weather data, we aim to identify patterns and provide actionable insights.
